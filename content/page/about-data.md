## Origin
This data was taken from _Interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein levels change in chronic dialysis patients prior to death_ (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697046/">Usvyat et al., 2013</a>)

## Data Manipulation and Music Generation
1. Took a 5-week rolling average to smooth out the data
2. Re-scaled the values between 0 and 1
3. Presented the values in chronological order, representing weeks leading to death
4. Assigned each clinical parameter to an instrument of a different type
5. Created instrumentation files based on musical aims
6. Algorithmically generated a musical sequence strictly based on the data presented, using the instrumentaion files created
